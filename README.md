# Comment Hub

Comment Hub is a straightforward application that simplifies exploring Reddit discussions on a given topic. It collects and displays the top comments from Reddit posts found through Google search results related to your query.

### How it works:
1. Enter a question, and the app uses the Google API to find top Reddit links related to your query.
2. View the top comments from each Reddit post linked to your search. You can also use filters for a more precise search.

I built this app because I was tired of opening multiple Reddit tabs to analyze comments when seeking opinions or information.
